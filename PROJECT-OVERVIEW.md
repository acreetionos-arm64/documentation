# AcreetionOS ARM64 Port - Development Project

**Project Lead**: John Junkins (@macjunkins)
**Status**: Side project - flexible timeline development
**Architecture Target**: ARM64/aarch64
**Base Distribution**: AcreetionOS (Arch-based)
**Estimated Effort**: 180-250 hours over 18-36 months

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an ARM64 port of AcreetionOS Linux distribution as an independent side project. AcreetionOS is a community-driven, lightweight Linux distribution based on Arch Linux, focused on simplicity and stability.

### Project Philosophy

**Sustainable Side Project Approach**:
- No artificial deadlines or weekly schedules
- Work progresses as time and interest permit
- Focus on learning and creating something worthwhile
- Realistic 18-36 month completion window

**Independent Development**:
- Self-contained using GitHub infrastructure
- Hybrid approach: 90% upstream ARM packages + 10% custom AcreetionOS components
- No dependencies on fragile upstream GitLab infrastructure

## Technical Foundation

### Current x86_64 Build System
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd acreetionos-junkins-fork/

# Full build process
./build.sh                    # Runs: ./refresh.sh -j && ./mkarchiso.sh

# Manual build
mkarchiso -L AcreetionOS -v -o ../ISO . -C ./pacman.conf
```

### ARM64 Conversion Requirements
- **Architecture**: Change `arch="x86_64"` to `arch="aarch64"` in profiledef.sh
- **Packages**: Convert packages.x86_64 → packages.aarch64 (75.9% compatibility)
- **Boot System**: Implement U-Boot or ARM64 UEFI (complete rework)
- **Repositories**: Coordinate ARM64 package repositories (external dependency)

## Technical Strategy

### Hybrid Package Approach
**90% Base Packages**: Use official Arch Linux ARM repositories
- Kernel, systemd, desktop environment, applications
- Maintained by Arch Linux ARM team with automatic security updates
- Battle-tested on ARM64 hardware

**10% Custom Packages**: Build only AcreetionOS-specific components
- Custom branding, themes, system installer configuration
- Distribution-specific settings and compatibility fixes
- Dramatically reduces maintenance burden

### Repository Strategy

**Option 1: Single Repository with Git LFS (Simple Start)**
- GitHub repository with Git LFS for large files
- Complete project in one location for easy management
- Professional CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Clear documentation and contribution guidelines

**Option 2: Multi-Repository with Git Submodules (Advanced Organization)**
*Future consideration when project grows or hits storage limits*

```
acreetionos-arm64-workspace/          # Main coordinating repository
├── CLAUDE.md                         # Master coordination guidance
├── README.md                         # Project overview and roadmap
├── docs/                            # Architecture docs, proposals
├── iso-builder/                     # Git submodule - main build system
├── custom-packages/                 # Git submodule - AcreetionOS components
├── testing-infrastructure/         # Git submodule - QEMU, hardware tests
└── releases/                       # Git submodule - ISOs and artifacts
```

**Benefits of Submodule Approach**:
- **Storage Management**: Each submodule gets 1GB Git LFS allowance (4-5GB total vs 1GB single repo)
- **Organization**: Root-level coordination with focused, independent components
- **CLAUDE.md Hierarchy**: Master guidance file with specialized guidance in each submodule
- **Educational Value**: Learn enterprise Git workflows used in large-scale projects
- **Selective Access**: Contributors can work on specific components without full checkout

**Trade-offs**:
- **Complexity**: Requires learning Git submodule workflows (`git submodule update --init --recursive`)
- **Coordination**: Changes across submodules need careful commit sequencing
- **CI/CD Setup**: GitHub Actions require submodule-aware configurations

**Decision Point**: Start with Option 1 for simplicity, migrate to Option 2 if storage limits or organization complexity warrant the additional learning investment.

**Respectful Relationship with Upstream**:
- Proper attribution and credit to AcreetionOS team
- Optional collaboration opportunities
- Potential future contribution of improvements
