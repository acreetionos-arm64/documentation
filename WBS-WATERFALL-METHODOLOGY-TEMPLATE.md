# WBS/Waterfall Methodology Implementation Guide

**Template for implementing structured Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) with Waterfall methodology in software development projects**

## Executive Summary

This document provides a complete implementation guide for establishing a structured Waterfall development methodology with comprehensive Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) issue tracking. This approach prioritizes systematic development over agile iteration, ensuring complete traceability and dependency management.

**Key Principles:**
- **No Agile**: Sequential milestone completion, dependency-driven development
- **WBS Numbering**: All development follows `M[milestone].[component].[task]` numbering
- **Systematic Execution**: Every piece of work has a tracked, numbered issue
- **Dependency Management**: Clear sequencing prevents blocked development

---

## Quick Start Implementation

### Step 1: Repository Setup
1. Create GitHub repository for your project
2. Create GitHub organization (optional but recommended for multi-repo projects)
3. Enable Issues and Projects in repository settings

### Step 2: Create Milestones
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --method POST \
  --field title="M1: Foundation & Architecture" \
  --field description="Core architecture and infrastructure setup (estimated hours)" \
  --field due_on="2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"

gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --method POST \
  --field title="M2: Core Implementation" \
  --field description="Main feature development and integration (estimated hours)" \
  --field due_on="2026-06-30T23:59:59Z"
```

### Step 3: Create Component Labels
```bash
# Create component labels for desktop application structure
gh label create "ui" --description "User interface, MVVM, windows, controls" --color "28a745"
gh label create "core" --description "Business logic and application services" --color "1d76db"
gh label create "data" --description "Data models, storage, database layer" --color "f9ca24"
gh label create "infrastructure" --description "Deployment, packaging, CI/CD" --color "8b5cf6"
gh label create "testing" --description "Testing and quality assurance" --color "fb923c"
gh label create "documentation" --description "Technical docs and user guides" --color "0969da"
gh label create "security" --description "Data protection and platform integration" --color "d73a49"

# Create priority labels
gh label create "priority:critical" --description "Critical priority tasks" --color "b91c1c"
gh label create "priority:important" --description "Important priority tasks" --color "f59e0b"

# Create complexity labels
gh label create "complexity:low" --description "Low complexity tasks" --color "10b981"
gh label create "complexity:medium" --description "Medium complexity tasks" --color "f59e0b"
gh label create "complexity:high" --description "High complexity tasks" --color "ef4444"
```

### Step 4: Create Project Board
```bash
gh project create --title "[Project Name] Development" --owner [username-or-org]
```

---

## WBS Numbering System

### Format: `M[milestone].[component].[task]`

**Component Numbers for Desktop Applications:**
```
1 = ui               (User interface, MVVM, windows, controls)
2 = core             (Business logic, services, application architecture)
3 = data             (Data models, storage, Entity Framework/SQLite)
4 = infrastructure   (Deployment, packaging, auto-updates, CI/CD)
5 = testing          (Unit tests, UI automation, integration tests)
6 = documentation    (Technical docs, user guides, help system)
7 = security         (Data protection, authentication, platform integration)
```

**Examples:**
- `M1.1.1` - Setup WPF/WinUI project structure
- `M1.3.1` - Design data models and local storage
- `M2.1.1` - Implement main application windows
- `M2.7.1` - Add Windows security integration

---

## Development Workflow Rules

### WBS Compliance Requirements
1. **All Issues Must Use WBS Format**: `M[milestone].[component].[task] - [Description]`
2. **No Work Without Issues**: Every development task requires a tracked WBS issue
3. **Sequential Dependencies**: Tasks must complete dependencies before starting
4. **One Task In Progress**: Limit work-in-progress to maintain focus
5. **Complete Before Moving**: Mark tasks complete only when fully done

### Issue Management Process
```bash
# 1. Start work on issue (update status)
gh issue edit [issue-number] --add-label "status:in-progress"

# 2. Complete work (mark as complete)
gh issue close [issue-number] --comment "Completed: [brief description of work done]"

# 3. Update project board
gh project item-add [project-number] --owner [owner] --url [issue-url]
```

### Dependency Management
- **Document dependencies** in each issue's Technical Details section
- **Reference blocking issues** using GitHub issue references (#123)
- **Follow strict sequencing** - no parallel work on dependent tasks
- **Update dependent issues** when blockers are resolved

---

## Community Triage Strategy

### Internal vs External Issues
**Internal Development (WBS Required):**
- All planned development work
- Feature implementations
- Architecture changes
- Infrastructure updates

**External Community Issues (Separate Tracking):**
- Bug reports from users
- Feature requests from community
- Documentation improvements
- General questions and support

### Triage Process
1. **External Issues**: Label as `community`, `bug`, `feature-request`, or `question`
2. **Evaluate for WBS Integration**: Determine if issue fits into planned milestones
3. **Create WBS Issue**: If accepted, create proper WBS issue and reference community issue
4. **Maintain Separation**: Keep community issues separate from structured development

---

## Project Board Organization

### Minimal Overhead Setup
**Use Only Default Fields:**
- Title (default)
- Status (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- Assignees (default)
- Labels (default)
- Milestone (default)

**Avoid Custom Fields** - Keep overhead minimal, use issue labels for all metadata

### Board Organization
```
Columns:
├── 📋 Todo (M1)          - All M1 issues ready to start
├── 📋 Todo (M2)          - All M2 issues (blocked until M1 complete)
├── 🔄 In Progress       - Currently active work (limit 1-2 issues)
├── 👀 Review           - Completed work pending review/testing
└── ✅ Done             - Completed and verified work
```

### Automation Rules
```yaml
# .github/workflows/project-automation.yml
name: Project Board Automation
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, closed, reopened]

jobs:
  update-project:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Add issue to project
        if: github.event.action == 'opened'
        # Add automation for adding issues to project board

      - name: Move to done
        if: github.event.action == 'closed'
        # Add automation for moving completed issues
```

## Quality Standards & Best Practices

### Issue Quality Requirements
- **Specific and Actionable**: Each issue represents concrete deliverable
- **Properly Estimated**: Hour estimates based on similar past work
- **Clear Dependencies**: Blocking relationships explicitly documented
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable completion requirements

### Code Quality Integration
```bash
# Add to your desktop development workflow
dotnet build                    # Compilation verification
dotnet test                     # Unit test execution
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"  # Test coverage
# For WPF/WinUI UI testing
dotnet test --filter "Category=UITest"       # UI automation tests
# Static analysis
dotnet format                   # Code formatting
# Package and deployment testing
dotnet publish -c Release      # Release build verification
```

### Documentation Standards
- **Technical Decisions**: Document architectural choices in issues
- **User Documentation**: In-app help system and user guides
- **Setup Instructions**: Clear environment setup and build instructions
- **Deployment Guides**: Installation, packaging, and distribution documentation
- **WBS Compliance**: All documentation work tracked through WBS issues

---

## Success Metrics & Monitoring

### Development Metrics
- **Issue Completion Rate**: Track milestone progress
- **Dependency Adherence**: Verify no work starts before dependencies complete
- **WBS Compliance**: 100% of development work tracked through numbered issues
- **Quality Gates**: All code passes tests and reviews before completion

### Project Health Indicators
- **Clear Next Steps**: Always know which WBS issue to work on next
- **No Blocked Work**: Dependencies resolved before starting new tasks
- **Visible Progress**: Project board accurately reflects current state
- **Maintainable Pace**: Sustainable development velocity without burnout

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "This feels too rigid"
**Solution**: The structure prevents technical debt and ensures nothing is forgotten. Start with smaller milestones if needed.

### "Dependencies are blocking everything"
**Solution**: This is intentional. Proper sequencing prevents rework. Use research tasks that can run in parallel.

### "Too much overhead for small changes"
**Solution**: Group small related changes into single WBS issues. Not every commit needs its own issue.

### "Community wants different features"
**Solution**: Use triage process. Community issues are separate from planned WBS development.

---

## Conclusion

This WBS/Waterfall methodology provides:
- **Complete Traceability**: Every piece of work is planned, tracked, and numbered
- **Systematic Progress**: Clear milestone progression with no missed requirements
- **Quality Focus**: Dependencies and testing built into the development process
- **Professional Structure**: Supports collaboration and community contribution
- **Predictable Delivery**: Hour-based estimates and milestone tracking

The methodology scales from personal projects to large team development while maintaining systematic execution and quality standards.

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Create milestone
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones --method POST --field title="M1: Name" --field description="Description"

# Create WBS issue
gh issue create --title "M1.1.1 - Task description" --milestone "M1: Name" --label "enhancement,component,priority:level,complexity:level"

# Add issue to project board
gh project item-add [project-number] --owner [owner] --url [issue-url]

# Start work on issue
gh issue edit [issue-number] --add-label "status:in-progress"
